    <h1>B.Tech (IT & Mathematical Innovation)</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Concept</h2>
    <p>Cluster Innovation Centre, University of Delhi offers a four year B.Tech. Programme in Information Technology &amp; Mathematical Innovations. This unique course, the first one to be offered at Cluster Innovation Centre, is designed to inculcate an innovation mindset as part of the curriculum and pedagogy. Building strong analytical skills through Mathematics and application skills of Information Technology (IT), this course encourages students to recognize the connectedness of various disciplines. Using IT as a vehicle for connecting mathematics with other disciplines, students are encouraged to develop innovative products and processes as part of curriculum. The course aims to produce adequately skilled graduates with a creative mindset who can provide new solutions to industry in particular and to society in general. It is hoped that some of these innovators will be entrepreneurs, who will be job providers rather than job seekers. The course is specifically designed to boost undergraduate research.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The course offers three specialization streams – Management, Electronics, Embedded System and Systems Biology – important fields of education with significant interface with Mathematics and IT currently.</li>
        <li>The mode of learning shall be a healthy and productive blend of the formal and the inquiry based, with special focus on “hands on” and “project based” mode of learning. Learning shall happen to a large extent through teacher mentoring and peer learning that encourages creativity and relies on innovations.</li>
        <li>
            Upon graduation, these students would have acquired innovation based creativity and would have matured in their thinking. They will have enhanced their communication and leadership abilities, and will have understood the deep and abiding connections between knowledge and its uses - between understanding the needs of society and the relevance of knowledge and the importance of societal obligations. Experiments, hands-on projects, innovative projects, model implementations linked to the curriculum will be carried out in the “Engineering Kitchen: Innovation Lab”. Assessment, at each stage, is designed in a manner to incentivize innovation by encouraging students to carry out new creative application of the theoretical knowledge acquired, either through a project, or through a laboratory activity/prototype in the engineering kitchen.

    <h4>Evaluation Scheme</h4>
    <p>There will be continuous assessment based on class tests, presentations, seminars, assignments, projects etc. There will be an Evaluation and Review Committee (ERC) for each Semester. The Programme Coordinator will be the Chairman of the ERC and all CONVENERS (teachers teaching major portions of a paper) concerned for the semester will be its members.</p>
    <strong>Functions Of The ERC</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>To finalize examination schedule, its notification, preparation of invigilation chart and conduct of end semester examinations.</li>
        <li>To ensure timely Preparation of question papers and Evaluation of answer books for the end semester examination. ERC may assign full or a part of the work to any other faculty member of CIC.</li>
        <li>To periodically assess the continuous evaluation of the papers and project/internship.</li>
        <li>To determine and notify the eligibility of appearing in the end semester examination based on the attendance percentage prior to the commencement of the end semester examination.</li>
        <li>To ensure timely notification of internal assessment marks. To consider such individual representations of students about internal evaluation which have not been possible to reconcile between the student and the concerned teacher and take the remedial action if needed. The case will be scrutinized by the ERC and the decision of the ERC shall be final.</li>
        <li>Students will be shown the evaluated end semester answer books within ten days of the completion of the end semester evaluation. Any discrepancy may be brought to the notice of ERC. The case will be examined by ERC with one outside expert to be appointed by the Program Coordinator, and the decision of the ERC shall be final.</li>
        <li>To review and moderate end semester results of each class with a view to maintain uniformity of standard.</li>
        <li>To prepare the consolidated results semester wise and sending them to the University Examination Branch for declaration of results, and also to ensure reconciliation with university database for future reference and issue of marksheets/transcripts.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h4>Evaluation</h4>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>The evaluation or assessment for each theory paper with 4 credits shall be based on regular internal assessment throughout the semester (25 marks), a semester long innovation project in the field (25 marks, evaluated as part of the end semester examination) and a final end-semester written examination (50 marks).</li>
        <li>
            The evaluation or assessment for each theory paper with 3 credits shall be based on regular internal assessment throughout the semester (20 marks), and a final end-semester written examination (55 marks).
        </li>
        <li>
            The evaluation or assessment for each theory paper with 2 credits shall be based on regular internal assessment throughout the semester (15 marks), and a final end-semester written examination (35 marks).

    <ol type="i">
        <li>
            A candidate/group of candidates will be mentored by a teacher OR a responsible person in industry/organisation as assigned by the Programme Coordinator. On completion of the project, the students will submit a brief written report to the ERC. The report will be examined by a board of examiners (one board for 10 students), consisting of three members appointed by the Director, CIC on the recommendation of ERC.
        </li>
        <li>
            The evaluation will be on the work carried out by the student, written report and viva/ presentation. 60% weightage (90 marks) will be given to the continuous performance (by the mentor) and 40% weightage (60 marks) for the final assessment (by the board of examiners) after the completion of the project.
        </li>
    </ol>

        <b>Evaluation of 32 Credits Industrial Internship/Major Project (Semester VIII)</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        A dissertation should be submitted at the end of VIII semester. However, ERC may grant extension, not exceeding the maximum duration of the semester but not more than six months at a time. The dissertation will be examined by a board of three members appointed by the Director, CIC on the recommendation of the ERC. A viva-voce examination will be conducted by the board and marks awarded taking into consideration both dissertation and viva.
