    <p><strong><i>Learning and innovation go hand in hand. However the learning imparted a few years ago is not adequate for the Z generation. Change is inevitable and a constant factor in growth of everything. Without change neither innovation nor creativity can take place. Cluster Innovation Centre (CIC), University of Delhi was established in 2011 to inculcate a culture of innovation in educational pedagogy. The Centre initiated multidisciplinary courses, followed inclusiveness, imparted necessary skills and enhanced the knowledge base of students by following a hands-on activity approach. Since the centre initiated these changes a decade ago, it is now easy for the centre to adapt to the vision of the <abbr title="National Education Policy">NEP.</abbr> The innovative programmes at CIC enhance creative potential of students, have innovative curriculum, are more project oriented and tailored to the need of society and industry. It was envisaged that such programmes would enable students to relate themselves to the real world problems in all spheres and look for innovative solution for the problems.</i></strong></p>


    <p><strong><i> Centre had thus been designed to seek and drive innovations from industrial clusters, village clusters, slum clusters and educational clusters. CIC fosters a strong culture of research and knowledge generation. The students are actively engaged in projects that have helped them immensely for either their pursuit of higher education or employability. The project based mutidisciplinary courses help them to build necessary skills and knowledge base to solve real world problem and adopt the out-of-the-box thinking approach. The courses at Cluster Innovation Centre (CIC) are aimed at</i></strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Connecting research with application for the benefit of society.</i></li>
        <li><i>Supporting application oriented research to solve real world problems.</i></li>
        <li><i>Focusing on developing affordable innovations that can benefit a large number of people and at the same time commercially viable and sustainable.</i></li>
        <li><i>Encourage a culture of entrepreneurship for the University of Delhi.</i></li>
        
    </ul>



    







<p><strong><i>In a decade of its existence, the alumni of CIC has made us proud and given us a sense of belief that we are moving in the right direction of imparting education to our students with our flexible, holistic and multidisciplinary curriculum and engaging pedagogy. We believe that sky is the limit for our students and in the coming years the teaching pedagogy adopted by CIC will be a model that can be adopted by the whole country.</i></strong></p>
